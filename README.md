# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## PWSG

I creatived this webpage to make quick study guide to look over and fall back on during and after BootCamp classes has started. With each section being new to myself it is important to have a good guide for the main points such as; HTML, CSS, GIT, and JavaScirpt. And as I grow in my skills so to shall this website in the future:

- My motivation for this webpage is to simply go from zero programming skills to a confident programmer with having a webpage to look back on for helpful reference points.
- I built this webpage as a starter to my programming path. Learning what a basic page looks like on the front end and the back end aspests.
- Many problems were solved such as debugging code, to linking the projet from one source to another, then working through the issues that came with that.
- I learned that attention to detail is highly important and always double check your code. Follow the flow of your code to insure no mistakes were made, then always double and triple check your code. Command keys and funtions will need to better used/understood in the future to make coding more fluid.
